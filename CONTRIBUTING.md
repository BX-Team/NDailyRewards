<h1 align="center">Contributing</h1>
You are free to modify the plugin code under the MIT license, but you are not allowed to publish the plugin on your behalf. 
You can create a Pull Request and maybe I will accept your modifications. After I will publish an update on CurseForge and I will point you as contributor

Good Luck ;D
